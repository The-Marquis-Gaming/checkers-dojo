# Checkers

Checkers is a classic board game implemented in a web environment using the Dojo Engine. This project leverages Starknetâ€™s Layer 2 to create a fully decentralized, on-chain checkers game. All game logic, including player moves, validations, and win conditions, is implemented with smart contracts on Starknet, ensuring transparency and fairness.

## Quick Start Guide

### Terminal 1: Start Katana

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
cd dojo-starter
katana --dev --dev.no-fee --http.cors_origins=*
```

### Terminal 2: Build and Migrate the Project

In a second terminal, execute:

```bash
cd dojo-starter
sozo build
sozo migrate
torii --world 0x01dfabd3b24f954fff521af09a053f718b4255e4cc37ceaa5137bce73854d8ca --http.cors_origins=*
```

### Terminal 3: Start the Client

In a third terminal, navigate to the client folder and run:

```bash
cd client
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

## Cartridge Controller

To test the connection with the controller, follow these steps:

### Configure mkcert for HTTPS

You can configure mkcert to enable HTTPS and work with the controller directly, without requiring ngrok. Follow the steps below based on your operating system:

#### Windows

For Windows installation and configuration of mkcert, follow the guide in the link below:\
[mkcert Windows Setup Guide](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/357#issuecomment-1466762021)

#### Linux

For Linux installation and configuration of mkcert, follow the official guidelines provided in these links:

- [Linux Installation Steps](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#linux)
- [mkcert Installation Guide](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#mkcert)

These guides provide detailed steps to set up mkcert on various Linux distributions.

#### Check HTTPS Security in the Browser

- After completing the mkcert configuration, visit your local site.
- The browser should display **"This page is secure (valid HTTPS)"**.
- If the page shows as **insecure**, the mkcert configuration is incorrect.

### Alternative to mkcert: Use ngrok

Run the following command to use ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 5173
```

With this, you will be able to use the connection with the controller.
